# Console Ticket Booking Project
This project contains basic console Train ticket booking application from scratch in python 3.12

It contains few key concepts and some new things introduced in 3.7 version of python

This particular project covers below things ...

1. Classes with dataclass
2. Python decorators used in classes (classmethod, staticmethod)
3. ABC module for Abstraction (abstracmethod)
4. argparse module for parsing the command line argument
5. Magic methods and __post_init__ method

Others basic concepts which were used ...

a) Type hinting (we can use without this as python is dynamically typed language)
b) Match statement (switch in other language)
c) Class variables and Instance variables
d) Inheritance and Abstraction

Note : If any bugs or defects, even any non-standardization things found in this code, feel free to change it.
